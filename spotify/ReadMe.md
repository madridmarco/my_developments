This is a Python script that implements an authorization flow for the Spotify API. It uses the Requests library to make HTTP requests to the Spotify authorization and token endpoints. The script also uses the webbrowser library to open the user's default web browser and the BaseHTTPRequestHandler from the http.server library to create a simple HTTP server to handle the redirect from the Spotify authorization endpoint.
